 - Thread safety of plan creation and execution (TODO: what guarantees do we
   have from FFTW?).
 - Explicit versions in build-depends.
 - Remove the /opt/local additions.
 - Generalize to all types from Data.Vector.Generic?
 - For Invertible/Orthogonal, don't directly export functions from
   other modules, so each way is more self-consistent in Haddock.
 - Maybe better to have normalizeInput/output :: Vector -> Vector?
