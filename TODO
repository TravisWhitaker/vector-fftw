 - Thread safety of plan creation and execution (TODO: what guarantees do we
   have from FFTW?).
 - Explicit versions in build-depends.
 - Remove the /opt/local additions.
 - Generalize to all types from Data.Vector.Generic?
 - Maybe better to have normalizeInput/output :: Vector -> Vector?
 - Rest of the orthonormal transforms.
 - Call Orthonormal.dct3 really idct2?
 - Tests that I'm using all of vector's unsafe ops correctly.
 - General tests (incl. that the invertibility/orthonormality is true).
 - Can we get more accuracy wrt normalizations?
 - Add a note that this doesn't return [1..5] (b/c output is even)
        run dftC2R $ run dftR2C $ fromList [1..5]
   and must be replaced by:
        execute (plan dftC2R 5) $ run dftR2C $ fromList [1..5]
 - Create performance benchmarks using criterion.
 - Get the inlining to work properly, both when using "run" and when using
   "plan" plus several executes.
